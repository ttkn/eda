The files in this repository are charts of EPA air pollution data collected from 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. Using two plotting systems (base & ggplot2), the graphs show the total emissions from the entire United States as well as totals for specific locations, such as Baltimore and Los Angeles. Unlike the introduction-to-R repository, the code in this repository uses the dplyr library to streamline the process of subsetting and filtering the data instead of doing it manually.

The dataset divided into two files, with the larger one (6.5 million rows) containing all of the observations and the smaller one containing the keys for identifying the numerous pollution codes. Download here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip
