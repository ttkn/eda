The files in this repository are charts of EPA air pollution data collected from 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. Using two plotting systems (base & ggplot2), the graphs show the total emissions from the entire United States as well as totals for specific locations, such as Baltimore and Los Angeles. Unlike the introduction-to-R repository, the code in this repository uses the dplyr library to streamline the process of subsetting and filtering the data instead of doing it manually.
